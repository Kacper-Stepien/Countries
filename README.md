# Countries
This is an app which I created to practice asynchronous JS. The idea for app comes from challenge on the frontendmentor site.

On the page are displayed cards with countries names, flags and basic information.

Data about countries are fetch from REST Countries API.

User can choose wheter display all countries, countries from region or one country searching by name.

After clicking in a card, the modal window with more information about country is displayed.

There's a option to switch between light and dark mode. Info about that is stored in local storage, so when you visit the page again, you will see the last selected mode.
